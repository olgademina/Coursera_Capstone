## 2. Data 

The necessary information required for the study will come from the following sources:

Open data from https://opendata.paris.fr/explore/dataset/arrondissements/ to get the geo information about administrative districts of Paris - arrondissements:

- Arrondissements number
- Arrondissements name
- Geographic coordinates (latitude, longitude)

Foursquare API (https://developer.foursquare.com/) to collect information on the target audience venues: high schools, universities and offices, as well as other venues/competitors in the district

After that we will leverage the data in order to find the most appropriate location to launch the client's business.
